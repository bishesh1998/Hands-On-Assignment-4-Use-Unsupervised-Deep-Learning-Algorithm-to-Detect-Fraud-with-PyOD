# Fraud Detection with PyOD AutoEncoder

This project is about implementing an unsupervised deep learning using PyODâ€™s AutoEncoder to detect fraudulent transactions in credit card data. The script containing python codes is saved as fraud_autoencoder.py and manifest is saved as manifest.yaml. this model is designed to learns normal patterns and distinguish them from fraudulent patterns to flags anomalies based on reconstruction errors.

## Quick start

pip install -r requirements.txt
python train_autoencoder.py
